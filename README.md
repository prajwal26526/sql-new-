this project involves working with a sample database to demonstrate core SQL skills. The task includes:

Creating a new table or using an existing schema.

Inserting new data entries, some of which include missing or unavailable data represented by NULL values. NULL is used in SQL to signal missing, unknown, or inapplicable information and is different from zero or an empty string.

Using the INSERT INTO statement for adding records, and explicitly placing NULL in columns with missing data or relying on table defaults when applicable.

Applying data cleaning by using UPDATE statements to identify and fix inconsistencies, such as replacing NULLs with default values, correcting errors, or standardizing the dataset.

Using DELETE statements with suitable WHERE clauses to remove unwanted or inconsistent records from the database.
Ensuring that the final dataset is well-populated, clean, and maintains data integrity.

This task prepares learners to efficiently insert, modify, and remove data, while understanding the implications of missing information and best practices for handling NULLs in SQL.
